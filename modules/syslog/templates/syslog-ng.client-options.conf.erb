#
# Configuration file for syslog-ng under Debian
#
# attempts at reproducing default syslog behavior

# the standard syslog levels are (in descending order of priority):
# emerg alert crit err warning notice info debug
# the aliases "error", "panic", and "warn" are deprecated
# the "none" priority found in the original syslogd configuration is
# only used in internal messages created by syslogd

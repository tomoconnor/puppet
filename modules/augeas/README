= Augeas Puppet module =

== Usage ==

  include augeas

== Description ==

This module does 3 things:

 o provides a few lenses only included in recent augeas releases.
 
 o creates /usr/share/augeas/lenses/contrib in which other modules can put
   custom lenses (see puppet-mysql/puppet-haproxy for working examples).

 o let's you force the version by defining $augeas_version, else puppet will
   only ensure the packages are present.

  # We only require "st" or "state" field to determine in which state a particular
  # connection (or socket if you wish) is in currently:
  #
  #  00, and FF (a bad state which is impossible to achieve)
  #  01 - ESTABLISHED
  #  02 - SYN_SENT
  #  03 - SYN_RECV
  #  04 - FIN_WAIT1

  # the "proc" file system that was reported more than once in the past ...

# This fact provides unique system identification in form of an RFC 4122
# compliant UUID version 5 type identifier.  Currently we generate said
# UUID using SHA-1 hash and rely on the "fqdn" (fully-qualified domain
# name) fact availability since we use DNS name space when generating
# the UUID version 5 to be compliment with the standards ...
#
# There is probably a room for discussion on the matter of which type
# of UUID should be used i.e. UUID version 1 versus UUID version 5.
#
# Personally, I rely more on host name and generally on fully-qualified
# domain name these days over trusting that the same MAC address will
# be allocated to me upon re-building EC2 instance or generally working
# with virtual machines.  No to mention that reasonable accuracy of
# the monotonic clock on such systems is also a matter of discussion ...
#
# Please consult http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt for the details on
# UUID generation and example implementation.

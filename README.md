# Puppet config to go with the blogpost series at http://tomoconnor.eu/blogish

## Description
I've put this together to share some of the config of my puppet infrastructure.  Lots of it has been gleaned from other puppet repos, also on github, so there's probably lots of similarities between other stuff.

## Usage
As with most other puppet config, a lot of this is self-documenting, but this is pretty much an exact copy of a working `/etc/puppet`
